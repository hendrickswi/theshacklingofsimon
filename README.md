Here lies a Binding of Isaac ripoff being made for a school project. WIP

Controls: 
WASD for directional movement
Arrow keys for shooting
E/LShift/RShift for bombs
Left click (and mouse position relative to player) for shooting
Right click for bombs
esc to quit the game

Temporary controls for sprint2:
Y to show the next tile
T to show the previous tile
I to show the next item
U to show the previous item

Known bugs:
Memory usage is extremely high for projectiles
  Caused by: not using a object pool or simply dereferencing the projectiles when they are unused
